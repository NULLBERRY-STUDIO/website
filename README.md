![Nullberry](https://res.cloudinary.com/dm9gvqa1t/image/upload/v1742349175/5f23fb84262d4fce8ed9c6b3c8dd3b7f_xj7k2m.webp)

## About Nullberry

Nullberry is a non-profit organization dedicated to building clean, free software without shareholder influence. We believe that truly valuable tools should be accessible to everyone and developed with users—not profit margins—in mind.

Our mission is to create software that respects user privacy, avoids dark patterns, and contributes positively to the digital ecosystem. As a non-profit, we're able to prioritize these values over quarterly growth targets or investor demands.

## Our Approach

- **Non-profit Philosophy**: We build software because we believe it should exist in the world, not because it will generate revenue.
- **User-Focused Design**: Our tools are built with genuine care for the craft and the people who use them.
- **Transparency**: We maintain open development practices and clear communication about our goals and methods.
- **Community-Driven**: We value feedback from our community and build tools that serve real needs.

## Featured Projects

### TypeFlow

TypeFlow helps you fine-tune your macOS key repeat settings without repeatedly logging out to test changes. This clean, minimal web application provides an interactive environment to test different key repeat speeds and delays, then generates the terminal commands needed to apply those settings to your system.

## Design Principles

Our site follows Bauhaus minimal design principles with:

- Clean lines and consistent spacing
- Typography-focused presentation
- A carefully crafted neutral color system for both light and dark modes

### Color System

#### Light Mode
- Page background: `bg-neutral-200`
- Card/UI backgrounds: `bg-neutral-100`
- Secondary elements: `bg-neutral-50`
- Borders: `border-gray-200` (primary), `border-gray-300` (secondary)
- Text: `text-gray-900` (headings), `text-gray-800` (primary), `text-gray-700` (secondary), `text-gray-600` (tertiary)

#### Dark Mode
- Page background: `bg-neutral-900`
- Card/UI backgrounds: `bg-neutral-800`
- Secondary elements: `bg-neutral-700`
- Borders: `border-gray-900` (primary), `border-gray-800` (secondary)
- Text: `text-white` (headings), `text-gray-200` (primary), `text-gray-300` (secondary), `text-gray-400` (tertiary)
